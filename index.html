            <p><strong>Reason: </strong>This site exists simply for experimentation purposes. I myself have always found parallax scrolling websites beautiful and awesome. Turns out the math is really simple. Anyway upon learning how to do parallax scrolling I decided it would be pretty neat to make a small website that expands upon the information given in my final project for chemistry. It's useful for anyone who may want more information on how LCDs work and I figure that the knowledge I gain from creating this won't go to waste. <strong>Also if Mrs. Mauer would like to give me some extra credit I wouldn't be opposed to the idea. ;)</strong> &lt;---</p>

           <p>While I'm fairly certain that all of you probably know what an LCD is by now (if not click <a class="hasPop" data-original-title="What is an LCD?" data-content="Well here is a hint, you are probably looking at one right now.<div class=&quot;thumbnail&quot;><a title=&quot;Need More?&quot; href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid-crystal_display&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;><img src=&quot;assets/img/LCD_example.jpg&quot; /></a><div class=&quot;caption&quot;><p>This is an image of a common LCD monitor for desktops.

It's also possible that you hear some of the specifications and numbers people talk about but have no idea what they mean. This section will hopefully clear some of that up for you.</p>

          <h3>Types of LCDs</h3>
          <div class="col-md-12">
            <h4>Backlighting</h4>
            <div class="col-md-12">
              <ul>
                <li>The first and most common type of backlighting in an LCD is CCFL backlighting. CCFL stands for Cold Cathode Flouresent Lamp. There are two variations of this, most monitors are lit from <a class="hasPop" data-placement="bottom" data-original-title="CCFL - One Side" data-content="<div class=&quot;thumbnail&quot;><a href=&quot;assets/img/CCFL_single.jpg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;><img src=&quot;assets/img/CCFL_single.jpg&quot; /></a><div class=&quot;caption&quot;><p>This is a backlight lit from only one side. A diffuser spreads the light evenly over the surface.</p></div></div>">one or two sides</a> and diffuser films spread the light evenly across the surface. The other variation involves an <a class="hasPop" data-placement="bottom" data-original-title="CCFL - Array" data-content="<div class=&quot;thumbnail&quot;><a href=&quot;assets/img/CCFL_array.jpg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;><img src=&quot;assets/img/CCFL_array.jpg&quot; /></a><div class=&quot;caption&quot;><p>This is a backlight that will be lit from an array of CCFLs, this type usually doesn't have a diffuser.</p></div></div>">array of CCFLs</a> across the whole surface. This variation typically has no or less diffuser films for spreading the light. For a very long time this technology was been used almost exclusivly. These backlights also require a power inverter to reach significantly higher voltages than what powers the display. These inverters can be pretty thick and they limit how thin you can make the display. In recent years more energy efficient technologies have been created and are now being used more often.</li>
                <li>One of the technologies becoming more widely used for backlighting is a technology called EL-WLED. EL-WLED stands for Edge Lit - White LED or even Edge Lit - White Light Emitting Diode if you want to break it down that far. This technology lights the whole display from <a class="hasPop" data-placement="bottom" data-original-title="Edge Lit White LED" data-content="<div class=&quot;thumbnail&quot;><a href=&quot;assets/img/LED_single.jpg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;><img src=&quot;assets/img/LED_single.jpg&quot; /></a><div class=&quot;caption&quot;>Similar to the CCFL backlight depicted earlier this backlight is lit only from one side and diffusers spread the light evenly across the surface.</div></div>">one or two sides</a> and again diffuser films are used to spread the light across the surface. Some monitors using this technology have a feature called "Dynamic Contrast" which will dim the brightness of the backlight to the brightest color on the screen. This gives monitors that would normally have a <a class="hasPop" data-placement="top" data-original-title="What is this?" data-content="In LCDs the contrast ratio is the ratio of the luminance of the brightest color (white) to the luminance of the darkest color (black).<br><br>For example if during testing they make the screen white and measure a luminance of 45 foot-lamberts and then they make it black and measure only 0.01 foot-lamberts the contrast ratio of that display would be 4500:1.">contrast ratio</a> of around 1000:1 a contrast ratio of around 30000:1. However since white is almost always somewhere on the screen this feature is rarely practical as it is almost never used.</li>
                <li>Similarly there is also WLED backlighting. WLED simply stands for White LED or White Light Emitting Diode. The main difference between this and EL-WLED is that this is lit from an <a class="hasPop" data-placement="bottom" data-original-title="White LED Array" data-content="<div class=&quot;thumbnail&quot;><a href=&quot;assets/img/LED_array.jpg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;><img src=&quot;assets/img/LED_array.jpg&quot; /></a><div class=&quot;caption&quot;>This type of backlight provides a much more reliable alternative to the EL-WLED &quot;Dynamic Contrast&quot; feature because of its ability to dim individual LEDs in dark areas of the screen. Unlike the CCFL array this usually has the same diffusers as the EL-WLED.</div></div>">array of LEDs</a> behind the diffuser. Most monitors with this type of backlight have the ability to dim specific LEDs in the dark areas of the screen. That provides a much more reliable way to increase the contrast ratio.</li>
                <li>The final and by far most expensive type of backlight is the RGB-LED array. RGB-LED stands for Red Green Blue - Light Emitting Diode. These are a special type of LED capable of producing any color in the visible spectrum. The LEDs are arranged in an <a class="hasPop" data-placement="bottom" data-original-title="RGB-LED array" data-content="I appologize, I was unable to locate a good image of an RGB-LED backlight. I suppose people don't like tearing apart their rediculously expensive monitors. Just picture the WLED array but with more LEDs and some of them are colored.">array similar to the WLED</a> backlight however it is capable of providing color specific light allowing for very vibrant colors to be visible on the LCD. RGB-LED array backlighting is by far the best in terms of its capabilities, the colors are unbelievably rich however, even small monitors with this type of backlight tend to cost upwards of $1000 as of <span title="2014-05-04">today</span>.</li>
